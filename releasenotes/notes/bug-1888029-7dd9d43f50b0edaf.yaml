    [`bug 1888029 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1888029>`_]
    Support for automatically deprovisioning role assignments that should no
    longer be mapped to federated users, either according to an updated mapping
    definition or changes to the user's group/roles on the external IdP. This
    is disabled by default but can be turned on via the new
    ``remove_dangling_assignments`` configuration option in the ``[mapped]``
    group.
